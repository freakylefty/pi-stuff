# TTS

> Speakers

Not really Raspberry PI related, but a component of another project.  I include it separately here simply because of the effort involved in getting it working.  As the name suggests, it's a simple text-to-speech script.

## Instructions

Requirements:
- gtts package
- Internet access to leverage Google services
- Permissions to write temp files

Run `python3 main.py "<text to say>"`
e.g. `python3 main.py "this is some text"`
