# Conway's game of Life

> Display HAT

A simple version of Conway's Game of Life, with a couple of twists - colour is based off time (one channel per hour/minute/second), and out of bounds neighbours count as random cells to keep the simulation 'alive'.

## Disclosure

Copilot wrote the actual simulation, purely as a time saver, because I've written so many in my life there wasn't much value in it for me and I wanted to move onto the part about making it work on the Display HAT.  Copilot was also the source of much of the information used in [terminal.py](terminal.py) because honestly `*gestures at what Google Search has become*`

## Instructions

Required packages:
- PIL
- DisplayHATMini
- pygame

Start with `python3 main.py`, press `esc` to exit
