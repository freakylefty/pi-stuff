# Creepy

> Sense HAT

One of the first things I made for the Raspberry PI, and also one of my first forays into Python.

A project made for my children, it just cycles through a series of sprites based of Minecraft creatures (this being back when Minecraft was the biggest and best thing in my kids' worlds)

## Instructions

Required packages:
- SenseHat

Start with `python3 creepy.py`
Press the joystick button on the Sense HAT to pause/unpause the cycling images
